## Portfolio Summary

I am an undergraduate Computer Science student, with a focus on open-source development and robust solutions for security analysis and automation.

### Featured Projects

**sys-scan-graph**  
A comprehensive Linux system security scanner featuring a high-performance C++20 core and a Python intelligence layer orchestrated through LangGraph. The tool includes over sixteen specialized scanners covering process, network, kernel, privilege escalation, indicators of compromise, mandatory access controls, and compliance checks, producing reproducible, canonical JSON output.
For sys-scan-graph, zero-trust principles are applied in full, reflecting the sensitive nature of system-wide data. All analysis is strictly local, with no external API calls or network access. The user retains complete control over execution privileges, ensuring privacy, security, and auditability. The intelligence layer incorporates a fine-tuned Mistral-7B language model with LoRA adapters, offering advanced risk scoring, correlation, and MITRE ATT&CK mapping. The project features extensible architecture, thorough documentation, and a comprehensive test suite exceeding nine hundred cases.

**sys-scan-agent_MLops**  
An MLOps pipeline dedicated to synthetic data generation and large language model fine-tuning for security analysis tasks. This system produces millions of realistic findings using advanced optimization techniques such as Lion optimizer, LoRA, and GPTQ quantization. All inference runs securely and efficiently on local infrastructure.

**sys-scan-UI**  
A native C++ GTK4 dashboard designed for interactive analysis of sys-scan-graph security reports. The user interface provides real-time filtering, visualization of correlations, and integrates a human-in-the-loop Investigation Director node using LangGraph.

### Technical Philosophy

I approach software engineering with an emphasis on understanding and precision. Machine learning is valued as a powerful tool, but never as a black box. Security and privacy controls are tailored to the context and sensitivity of each solution, with sys-scan-graph exemplifying strict zero-trust practices. My work prioritizes reproducibility, extensibility, and transparency.
