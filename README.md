### Hey there, I’m Joe (J-mazz)

I'm a Computer Science undergrad who got into machine learning 
before the lectures ever started. I taught myself Python, 
shell scripting, and ML fundamentals—and that curiosity 
still drives everything I build.

Most of my time goes into open-source projects, where I focus on:
- ML pipelines & model training (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Data-centric workflows & augmentation
- Satellite imagery & CV using GGP, Sentinel, matplotlib
- NLP tools like citation parsers and bias detectors

You’ll find a bit of everything here—practical, open, and evolving.
I’m actively seeking freelance work or internship opportunities
where I can keep learning and contribute meaningfully.
