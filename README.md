- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @J-mazz
-
-    Iâ€™m interested in Machine Learning & Data pipelines,
-    automation with Python & Linux, and finding creative
-    solutions with the combination of these powerful tools.
-
-    Iâ€™m currently studying for my undergrad in CS but I have
-    been self learning for years python and ML tools/libraries
-    like Tensorflow, keras, huggingface, numpy, scikitlearn, etc ..
-    and of course Python. I am genuinely and deeply fascinated
-    in discovering tomorrow's solutions to today's problems.
-
-    I expect to earn my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science
-    from Oregon State University in 2028. (I am in a transfer
-    pathway from Rogue Community College.)
